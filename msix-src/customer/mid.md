[MID GmbH](https://www.mid.de/en) is a German ISV and one of the leading providers of modeling solutions. They have a catalog of products that can help companies from a wide range of sectors, from Business Process Management to Agile Consulting.

One of their lead software is called [Innovator Enterprise Modeling Suite](https://www.innovator.de/), a business tool for modeling and analyzing information from all domains and bringing your data together efficiently. It is currently used by more than 90 customers all around the world with over 16,000 individual users. The user front-end is a complex WPF application based on .NET Framework 4.5, with the particular requirement of being modular: 3rd party developers can develop and integrate plugins to enhance and extend the base application. Together with the server in the backend which hosts data repositories and all semantic configuration, it allows users to collaborate freely across all their models.

Their customers are mostly mid-sized to large companies which all have dedicated client management  in place. MID GmbH provides a MSI installer which could be managed in a basic way using command parameters for different installation scenarios. Due to the complexity of the configuration and the extensibility of the application, this approach has presented several challenges over the years:
1. Each release of the application requires multiple efforts from different teams: development (also 3rd party), client and server deployment and support. This has an impact on the complexity and cost of each update.
1. Since thereâ€™s a significant delay between the release of a new version and its deployment to each customer, the agility of the development team is severely impacted.
1. The slow release cycle reduces innovation opportunities for the company and the development team.

With the introduction of MSIX and .NET Core, MID has been able to address these challenges by:
1. Reducing the cost associated with each release. Thanks to MSIX, they are able to tailor an installation to the specific needs of the customer, significantly reducing the support and deployment efforts.
1. Improving the agility of customers, who are now able to deploy new versions of the desktop application as quickly as an update to the server and in a more reliable way.
1. Improving the agility of the development team, which is now able to release new features to customers quicker and adopt the latest and greatest technologies for Windows development.

With MSIX, MID GmbH has been able to simplify an overly complex deployment pipeline. Every new or updated version of the application had to be tested each  time by the customer in order to maintain security and availability of the client computers. Quite often, the customer has outsourced
