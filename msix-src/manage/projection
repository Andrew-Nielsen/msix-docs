# Ability to project files in MSIX packages
In order to satisfy existing ecosystem requirements, apps may require the files to appear to exist in their existing install directory, e.g. office plugins expect files to be in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office; that directory can be modified by admins. Thus, we allow apps to specify a directory outside of the WindowsApps directory, and deployment will use filter drivers in order to make the files appear in that location with the ACLs inherited from the parent directory.
