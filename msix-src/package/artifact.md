# MSIX Persistent Identity 
This feature enables the ability to sign packages with a new certificate while still maintaining the appâ€™s update experience. In other words, this allows the package to persist their old package identity in the platform without having the need to sign with the old (original) certificate. To achieve this, an artifact will need to be created to show the relationship between the old certificate and the new certificate that is being used for signing. Below is a step-by-step explanation of how to persist with the package identity to maintain he update experience. 

## Requirements
1. Obtain MakeAppx.exe through the Windows SDK. This feature is currently avaliable in the Windows SDK Preview. 
1. Obtain SighTool.exe through the Windows SDK 
1. The old certificate (CN=Old) that was used to sign the original package  
1. The new certificate (CN=New) that will be used to sign the package

## Walk thru
This is a step by step instructions on how to sign your package with the new certificate while maintaining the package identity. 

### Create the artifact 
1. Write the XML artifact detailing the old and new publishers. Name it anything you like, e.g. artifact.xml:
 ```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Publisher xmlns=http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/publisherbridging/2021 Old="CN=Old" New="CN=New" />
```
1. Write a Catalog Definition File (CDF) to create the catalog that will be used to sign the artifact. Name it anything you like, e.g. artifact.cdf:
 ```
[CatalogHeader]
Name=artifact.cat
CatalogVersion=2
HashAlgorithms=SHA256
 
[CatalogFiles]
<HASH>artifact.xml=artifact.xml
```
